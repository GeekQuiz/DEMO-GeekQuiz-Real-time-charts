	![Selecting the call to GetHubContext](Images/gethubcontext.png?raw=true "Selecting the call to GetHubContext")

	_Selecting the call to GetHubContext_

1. Highlight the `updateStatistics` method call.

	![Highlighting the updateStatistics method call](Images/updatestatistics.png?raw=true "Highlighting the updateStatistics method call")

1. Click `NotifyUpdates` and press **SHIFT + F12** to find all references to the method.

1. Double-click the `await this.statisticsService.NotifyUpdates();` reference in the **Find Symbol Results** window.

	_Navigating to the NotifyUpdates caller_

	> **Speaking point:** We are updating the stats for all clients every time a question is answered. If we were handling a large number of answers and clients simultaneously we could batch updates.

1. Press **CTRL + ,**, type _Statistics.cshtml_ and press **Enter**.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the file.

1. Highlight the `var hub = connection.createHubProxy("StatisticsHub");` line as shown in the following figure.
